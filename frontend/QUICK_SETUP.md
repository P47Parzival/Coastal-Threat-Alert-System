# ðŸš€ Quick Weather Map Setup

## Fix the White Screen Issue

The white screen is caused by a missing OpenWeatherMap API key. Here's how to fix it:

### 1. Get Free API Key (2 minutes)
1. Go to [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api)
2. Click "Sign Up" (free account)
3. Go to "My API Keys" section
4. Copy your API key

### 2. Create Environment File (30 seconds)
Create a file named `.env` in the `frontend` directory:

```bash
# OpenWeatherMap API Configuration
VITE_OPENWEATHER_API_KEY=your_api_key_here

# Backend API URL  
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:8000
```

### 3. Restart Development Server
```bash
# Stop the current server (Ctrl+C)
# Then restart:
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

### 4. Verify It Works
- Open http://localhost:5173
- Go to Dashboard
- You should see the weather map with real data!
