def download_liss4_data_for_aoi(aoi_id):
    # 1. Get AOI details from your database
    aoi_document = aoi_collection.find_one({"_id": ObjectId(aoi_id)})
    
    # 2. Setup a browser instance using Selenium/Playwright
    #    This should be a "headless" browser on your server.
    
    # 3. Navigate to Bhoonidhi login page
    #    browser.get("https://bhoonidhi.nrsc.gov.in/bhoonidhi/index.html")

    # 4. Find login fields and button, then enter credentials and click
    #    username_field = browser.find_element(By.ID, "username")
    #    username_field.send_keys("YOUR_USERNAME")
    #    ... (and so on for password and login button) ...
    
    # 5. Navigate to the data search/filter section
    #    This is the most complex part. You need to:
    #    - Select the correct Satellite/Sensor (Resourcesat-2, LISS-4).
    #    - Input the bounding box coordinates derived from the user's GeoJSON AOI.
    #    - Input the desired date range.
    #    - Click the "Search" or "Filter" button.
    
    # 6. Parse the results page
    #    - Wait for the search results table or list to load.
    #    - Loop through the results.
    #    - Find the download button/link for each relevant scene.
    #    - Click the download link.
    
    # 7. Manage the download
    #    - Selenium/Playwright needs to be configured to handle file downloads
    #      and save them to a specific directory on your server.
    #    - Let's say you save it to '/data/raw_liss4/{aoi_id}/'.
    
    # 8. Trigger the next step
    #    downloaded_file_path = "/data/raw_liss4/{aoi_id}/scene1.tif"
    #    run_custom_ml_pipeline.delay(aoi_id, downloaded_file_path)

    # 9. Close the browser instance
    #    browser.quit()
